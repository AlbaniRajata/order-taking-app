# Order-Taking-App 🛒

Welcome to the **Order-Taking-App**, a full-stack web application I built while learning from the **"Build Full Stack Web App with React and Firebase"** course on Udemy! This project represents my journey into full-stack development and serves as a stepping stone toward real-world web development.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Order-Taking-App** is designed to streamline the process of taking and managing orders. It features a React TypeScript frontend and Firebase backend services, including **Firestore** and **Authentication**.  

While I did not deploy this app due to debit/credit card limitations, it is fully functional locally and provides a great foundation for further development.

## ✨ Features and Custom Adjustments

### Core Features:
- **User Authentication:** Managed via Firebase Authentication.
- **Firestore Integration:** Efficient and scalable database for storing order data.
- **Dynamic UI:** Built with **Chakra UI** for a responsive and visually appealing interface.

### Custom Adjustments:
- Replaced the **email confirmation feature** with a **simple order confirmation button** for a more straightforward process.
- Modified the menu image upload functionality to use a **random image generator**, providing a new image every time the page reloads.
